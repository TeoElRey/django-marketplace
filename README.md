# django-marketplace

This project is a basic Ecommerce website designed to improve my skills and capabilities with django.
The project models other more popular marketplace websites such as facebook marketplace, ebay, etc.
This project includes all of the following features and more:

* Sign-up and log-in system
* Adding your own items to the site
* Inspecting items posted by other users
* Management system to edit or delete your items after they are posted
* Filtering system to filter items by categories or key words
* A dashboard interface where a user can see and access all of their posted items
* An Expansive messaging system where buyers and sellers can communicate about the product

With technology taking over the world, and commerce being more prominent online than anywhere else, there is no better place to make money than online!
This project is a representation of what a modern-day Ecommerce website needs in order to function successfully.

<sub>This project was built entirely from scratch using django</sub>
